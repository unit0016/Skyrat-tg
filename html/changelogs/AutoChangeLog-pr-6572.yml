  - balance: "Knives (such as the kitchen knife, hunting knife, combat knife, etc...) are generally more effective at causing slashing wounds now. The butcher's cleaver in particular is now equal to a circular saw in terms of wounding."
  - balance: "Scalpels are an eensy bit less effective at wounding enemies wearing armor, though they are still very effective at causing bleeding."
